# Random User Gallery

A web application that uses **jQuery** to fetch and display random user profiles from the [Random User API](https://randomuser.me/).  
Users are shown in an animated, interactive slider with styling and effects powered by **Fancybox** and **Slick Carousel**.

## 🎯 Purpose

This project was created to practice:
- Making API requests with jQuery
- Handling and displaying fetched data
- Integrating third-party libraries (Slick, Fancybox)
- DOM manipulation and animation

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- HTML  
- CSS  
- JavaScript (jQuery)  
- Fancybox

- Fetches and displays 5 random user profiles  
- Profiles include photo, name, email, country  
- Smooth fade-in animation and hover scaling

## 🧠 What I Learned

- How to use jQuery for AJAX requests  
- DOM element creation and manipulation  
- Managing animation and UI libraries  
- Structuring dynamic content from API data

## 👀 Why This Project Matters

This project demonstrates how older libraries like jQuery can still be used to create modern, interactive UIs.  
It's a great foundation for understanding **data-driven UI generation** and responsive design.
